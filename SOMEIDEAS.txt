SOME IDEA FOR GICYCLE10

1) WE HAVE A GOOD CRITERION TO FIND PSR. WE CAN ALSO SHOW THAT THIS WORKS FOR NEWLY DISCOVERED PSR
2) WE HAVE A LOT OF RESULTS FOR THE GC REGION AND WE CAN GIVE SOME RESULTS OF THEM

3) GENERALIZE THIS METHOD FOR THE ENTIRE PLANE
4) FINAL GOAL CHARACTERIZE THE PSR POPULATION OF THE DISK
5) GIVE LIST OF PROMISING TARGETS TO FOLLOW UP IN RADIO
6) GC EXCESS
7) TSMAP
